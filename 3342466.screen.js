The proposal to have an imperial museum came about because of the familiarity of several key players in the Ottoman political scene with the Louvre in Paris. The Ottoman sultan Abd\u00fclaziz (r. 1861\u20131876) was impressed by the archaeological museums in Paris (30 June \u2013 10 July 1867), London (12 July \u2013 23 July 1867) and Vienna (28 July \u2013 30 July 1867) which he visited in the summer of 1867, and ordered a similar archaeological museum to be established in Istanbul. The decision to establish an Imperial Museum under the Education Ministry came in 1869 with the appointment of a new director, but the idea of a museum was dropped with his resignation and because of budget restraints.<br\/><br\/>\nAs education minister in 1872, Ahmet Vefik Pasha set up a museum directorship for the second time and hired the German historian, archaeologist, epigraphist and painter, Dr. Phillip Anton Dethier. He proved to be so successful at collecting materials that the idea of a purpose-built museum gained traction.<br\/><br\/>\nWhen Dethier died in 1881, painter and archaeologist Osman Hamdi Bey was appointed to the position that same year.<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","updated":1418817155,"css":"","secured":false,"javascripts":[]}}});
